:package: Package delivery scheduler :package:
===
This is Guillaume's package delivery scheduler:
a simple 1-pager webpage for recipients to see what time their package is scheduled to arrive.

• The Map section uses Google Maps.
• the marker is shown at the correct address.
• Changing delivery time and subscribing to notifications are just mock ups for now.
• The user is able to add notes to the delivery.

How to run it locally:
